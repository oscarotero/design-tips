The default font size on the web is `16px` (or `1em`) which is the minimum size
for any text that must be easy to read. Long texts like posts or articles may be
in `18px` or `20px` which is an even more legible text size.

Font sizes below `16px` can be used for short texts, like labels or buttons, but
never smaller than `13.5px` (or `0.85em`).
