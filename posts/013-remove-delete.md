Use **Delete** when the action cannot be undone, and **Remove** if the item is
removed from the current context but still exists in the system somehow.

<!-- more -->

For example, you can **remove a tag** from a post, meaning that this tag no
longer is associated with this post. But **deleting a tag** means that this tag
is deleted completely from the database, so it will be removed from all
associated posts.
