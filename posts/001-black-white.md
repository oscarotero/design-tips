title: 001 - Don't use pure black & white for text
tags: [UI, color]

The contrast of pure black text `#000` over pure white background `#FFF` is too
strong and can be tiring on the eye for long texts. Use near-black colors and/or
near-white colors for better results.

In the following image, the text on the left is pure black, and the text on the
right is dark gray `#333` which looks better:

The same for dark backgrounds. On the left, a pure black background. On the right, there is a dark gray background (`#222`).
