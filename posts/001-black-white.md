title: 001 - Don't use pure black & white colors for text
tags: [UI, color]
---

The contrast of pure black text `#000` over pure white background `#FFF` is too
strong and can be tiring on the eye for long texts. Use near-black colors and/or
near-white colors for better results.

<figure style="color: black; background: white;">
  <p>This text is in pure black & white. There is too much contrast between the text color and the background color.</p>
</figure>

<figure style="color: #444; background: white;">
  <p>This text is dark gray, which looks nicer and it's easier to read, especially for long texts.</p>
</figure>

<figure style="color: white; background: black;">
  <p>The same happens with pure black backgrounds and white text. Reading long texts with this contrast is tiring.</p>
</figure>

<figure style="color: #ddd; background: #222;">
  <p>This is much better. The color of the text is light gray and the background is dark gray. The contrast is not too strong and it's easier to read.</p>
