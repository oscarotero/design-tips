According to Apple's iPhone Human Interface Guidelines, the recommended target
size of a button should be 44x44 pixels. Other style guides are more permissive,
allowing smaller sizes.

This is especially important for interfaces intended for touch devices because
fingers are not as precise as mouse cursors. I recommend a minimum target size
of 40x40 pixels (or `2.5em`), that is touch-device friendly and not too big for
cursors.
