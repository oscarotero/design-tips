Large texts need less space between the lines. The bigger the text, the lesser
the line height.

<!-- more -->

<figure>
  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.7">
  This text has a size of 18 pixels, with a line height of 170% (equivalent to 30.5 pixels), which looks great to read. You can have multiple lines and your eye never gets lost changing from one line to the next.
  </p>
</figure>

<figure>
  <p style="font-size: 36px; line-height: 1.7">
  But the same line height of 170% applied to this larger text in 36 pixels doesn't look so nice because the lines are too far apart.
  </p>
</figure>

<figure>
  <p style="font-size: 36px; line-height: 1.5">
  For large texts, we need to reduce the line height. This text has a line height of  150% (equivalent to 54 pixels), and it looks great again.
  </p>

The line height not only depends on the font size but also the font family and
the line length. This is an ability acquired with practice and eye training.
